    After reading the Pitchfork Gives Music 6.8 article from the ONION, I hadn’t realized how much it can affect someone's viewpoint when it comes to having an opinion on certain things in life. Before the internet, I felt like life was both easier and harder at the same time. It just became easier for people to get information quicker once the internet was created. </p>
    <p>In the past though, the internet wouldn’t form how someone's viewpoint on whether music was great or if shoes can be bought from bots when it came to them being a heavily WANTED shoe by thousands of people around the world. When people realized that social media can be a part of the internet though, all hell broke loose because people can talk to randoms or interact with each other through comments and direct messages instead of actually talking to others in person. </p>

    With that being said, I officially rate the internet a solid 5 because half of the things on the internet are good and half of it is really bad.
